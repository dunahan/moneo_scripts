# moneo_scripts
Scripts for Moneo, a tool to mass edit gff files of NWN 1 (&amp; EE)

Added a exemplary batch-file to work with the content of a module-folder. So it should copy that content to a temporary folder, pack it to an erf-file that moneo could work on and then extract it later to a seperate folder again. It is named ccef.bat... Thx to Proleric (NWN-Vault-Forums) and Varenx (Vault Discord) for the hints how to get this to work!
