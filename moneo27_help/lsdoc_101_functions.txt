LetoScript 101: Functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By now you should have a fairly strong grasp of the basic language itself. The
real power in LetoScript is in its modules (libraries) and their functions:
with them you can add new Fields to a GFF, list the resources in an ERF, look
up a StringRef in a TLK, even look for the newest BIC file in a servervault
folder - and quite a bit more, too.

Individual articles are available for every LetoScript function. To see a
list, use the list utility. To get a basic description of a function, use desc
(or describe, or explain) and its full name, such as: desc gff.add. You can
also get an overview of each module (try just desc or desc gff).

Then read a few examples and try playing with the function on your own.
example gff.add picks up where desc gff.add leaves off.

After you've gained a few levels in your Champion of LetoScript prestige
class, you may need a refresher on just the syntax of some function. For that,
use syntax: syntax gff.add (syntax add works too), syntax print, etc.
