LetoScript 101: Quotes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a common sticking point, so it's worth covering right here at the
start. In NWScript, there's just one way to quote strings: double-quotes. In
LetoScript, we have single quotes, double quotes, and even functions that act
likes single quotes and double quotes, in case you can't or don't want to use
the symbols themselves.

Single quotes are the simplest kind of quote, and should be your default
choice when in doubt. Single quotes don't do anything special. They give you
exactly the literal text inside of them. If you need a single quote inside a
single-quoted string, use \'. The only time single quotes are a bad idea is in
NWNX-Leto, where you should use q instead.

Double quotes will interpolate their contents, which means variables are
expanded, and escape sequences like \n are recognized. Interpolation is
convenient when you have big composite strings, but can be a hassle if your
string has any \ or / in it, because they both get interpolated.

The q and qq functions simulate single-quotes and double-quotes, respectively.
Both are very important functions to understand for NWNX-Leto, but for now,
just use '' and "" while you learn in Moneo.

Examples:

  # No interpolation:
  print 'Today\'s $10 word is: "interpolation".';

  # \ is interpolated for special characters.
  # \n is newline, \t is tab, \" is a double-quote,
  # \\ is the backslash, \/ is the slash:
  print "Two lines\nof text.";
  print "Some \"double quotes\"\tand\t\\ slashes \/\n";

  # / is interpolated for Fields.
  print "My name is /firstname /lastname.\n";

  # $ is interpolated for scalar variables.
  $vaultpath = 'C:\NWN\servervault';
  %bic = "$vaultpath\\$playername\\$file" or die $!;
