LetoScript 101: Fields
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Fields

Once you've got a file open, you probably want to look at or change some
Fields. If you need a primer on GFF and Fields, go to:
  http://nwn.bioware.com/developers/
And see also: info gff, info fields

Just as files have a unique symbol in LetoScript, so too do Fields: the
(forward) slash. This means Fields actually look a lot like Linux or HTML file
paths, as seen here:

  %bob = 'bob.bic' or die $!;
  print /firstname;
  print /lvlstatlist/[0]/lvlstathitdie;
  /LastName = 'the Minogon';
  /LvlStatList/[0]/LvlStatHitDie = 12;

Notice how Fields can be lowercase or "camelcase". LetoScript is case-
insensitive, use whatever looks better to you.

-- Field syntax

The LvlStatList example may be a little confusing if you're still unaccustomed
to GFF structure. The [0] in the path indicates Struct 0 (the first Struct) in
the List named LvlStatList. Likewise, inside that Struct is the Field named
LvlStatHitDie (among others). Here are the most important parts of the Field
syntax in LetoScript:

  /@                    # The root (Struct).
  /[0]                  # The first Field in the file.
  /LvlStatList/[-1]     # The last Struct in LvlStatList.
  /LvlStatList/[_]      # Same thing.
  /$foo                 # Field named by the value of $foo.
  /{'Placeables List'}  # A Field name with spaces in it.

  # Print a list (printlist) of every single Field's value in the file:
  pl /@;

  # Print a list of every single Field's name and value in the file:
  pl %_;
