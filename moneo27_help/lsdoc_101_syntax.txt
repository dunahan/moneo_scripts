LetoScript 101: Syntax
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The LetoScript language is a unique language. It is most like Perl, which
itself is related to C. Since NWScript is also related to C, LetoScript and
NWScript are like cousins twice-removed. The really basic syntax in LetoScript
will probably look very familiar to you.

Things like variables and loops start to look a little different: you'll see $
and @ in front of variables, and since loops can do things like iterate over
the Fields in a List, or the resources in an ERF, there are many new ways to
write a for loop, too.

The function syntax for LetoScript is more relaxed than in NWScript, where
parentheses are always required, and arguments must be given in order, but the
differences won't feel alien for long; and since learning all of the functions
in LetoScript is what will truly take the most time and be most worthwhile,
the bigger differences elsewhere won't hinder you much. Some of the more
technical syntax (like arrays and hashes) you may never even need or use at
all.
