LetoScript 101: Variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Variables

We've already looked at files and Fields, which are actually variables signed
with % and /. The two other types of variables are $ and @, which are scalars
and lists. Scalars are like the int and string types of NWScript rolled into
one. Any scalar can be either, and can even be converted back and forth. So
you don't need to declare its type, just assign it a value:

  $text = 'Hello, world.';
  print $text;
  $number = 3;
  print $number + $number;

  $bob = 'bob.bic';
  %bob = $bob or die $!;
  $name = /firstname;
  print "My name is $name.";

-- Lists

The other type of variable is a list, signed with @. Don't confuse lists with
Lists. A list variable is a type of variable with multiple values. A List
Field is a type of Field containing Structs. List variables are constructed
using parentheses, and accessed using square brackets:

  @colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue');
  print @colors.count;  # 3
  print $colors[0];     # red
  print $colors[1];     # green
  print $colors[2];     # blue
  print $colors[3];     # undefined value (warning)
  $colors[3] = 'white'; # add a new member
  print @colors;        # redgreenbluewhite
  print "@colors";      # red green blue white
  @colors = ();         # clear the list

Note the importance of $ when accessing a member of a list. The value you're
fetching is actually a scalar, hence the use of $. @foo[0] is not the same as
$foo[0]. See also: lsdoc hashes, lsdoc attributes

-- Special variables

LetoScript has a number of special variables. You don't need to know all of
them, they just make life easier:

  %_    File: the current file handle.
  %~    File: the current resource in a for %ERF loop.
  /@    Field: the root Struct.
  /~    Field: the current context in a for /LIST loop.
  $_    Scalar: the "understood" value (varies greatly by context).
  $!    Scalar: most recent error.
  @_    List: the arguments passed to a subroutine.
