/Categories/[_]/EntryList/[_]/Text = qq|<CUSTOM1717>(continued from previous)<CUSTOM1701>\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Bard Song<CUSTOM1701> \012- Bard Song and Curse Song have an altered progression, which can be seen from the table below (bonus to allies for Bard Song, and penalties to enemies for Curse Song). The table uses 'song levels' rather than bard levels, which bards can assign using song points. An in-depth explanation can be found by using the !bardsong command, which calls up a menu with information and options to set song levels.\012- The required Perform skill for Bard Song is equal to twice the Bard song level. If you do not have the required Perform skill, your song level will be limited to what your Perform skill allows.\012- The Artist feat adds two effective song levels. There is a Legendary Artist feat available in legendary levels which adds one effective song level and allows a second configuration for both bard song and curse song.\012- Bard song damage bonuses are roughly double on the bard singing the song. The actual progression is not shown in the song tables, but it is (bard song level+1)\0574, and uses the normal damage progression until it exceeds it at level 11.\012<CUSTOM1709>Lvl AB  Dam  W  F  R   HP  AC  Skill\0121   1   1    -   -   -   -   -    -\0122   1   1    1   -   -   -   -    -\0123   1   2    1   1   -   -   -    -\0124   1   2    1   1   -   -   -    -\0125   1   2    1   1   -   -   -    -\0126   1   2    1   1   1   -   -    1\0127   1   2    1   1   1   -   1    1\0128   1   2    1   1   1   8   1    1\0129   1   2    1   1   1   8   1    2\01210  1   2    1   1   1   8   1    2<CUSTOM1701>\012\012\012<CUSTOM1709>Lvl AB  Dam  W  F  R   HP  AC  Skill\01211  1   2    2  1  1   8   1    2\01212  1   3    2  1  1   8   1    3\01213  1   3    2  1  1   8   1    3\01214  1   3    2  1  1   16  1    3\01215  1   3    2  1  1   16  1    4\01216  1   3    2  1  1   20  1    4\01217  1   3    2  1  1   22  1    4\01218  1   3    2  1  1   24  1    5\01219  1   3    3  1  1   26  1    5\01220  1   3    3  1  1   28  1    5<CUSTOM1701>\012\012|;

In addition, if the TP roll exceeds the target's TR by 10 or more, the target must make a Will save against the destruction DC or be destroyed.\012- For turning constructs (requires Destruction Domain), the turner rolls TP + Spell Penetration + d20 against the construct's Spell Resistance.

/Categories/[_]/EntryList/[_]/Text = qq|<CUSTOM1717>(continued from previous)<CUSTOM1701>\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Honed Weapons<CUSTOM1701> \012- At Assassin 20, an Assassin with a base Strength or Dexterity of 30 can acquire a scabbard that lets them hone weapons. They may only have one honed weapon at a time, but may switch which one it is once per rest. A honed weapon can deliver severe wounds.\012- Only melee weapons may be honed, but an Assassin with at least 10 Monk levels may hone their gloves. Honed gloves receive a +2 to critical range.\012- Whenever a honed weapon hits, it rolls again, and if THAT roll is a hit, and is in the critical threat range, the target must roll a fortitude save vs. a DC of 35 + half the Assassin's DEX or STR modifier (whichever is higher) + 1 for every 3 Assassin levels above 29 (including legendary levels). The effects of the save are described below.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Penetrating Strike<CUSTOM1701> \012- For characters with between 20 and 27 Assassin levels, the honed weapon delivers penetrating strikes, inflicting added damage. The base strike damage added is equal to the Assassin's level, plus legendary levels if the characters control class is Assassin, plus the character's Strength modifier. Critical immune creatures hit by a penetrating strike suffer no damage if they save vs fortitude, and one quarter of the base damage if they fail. Non-critical immunes suffer one quarter of the base damage if they save vs fortitude, and one half the base damage if they fail.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Mortal Strike<CUSTOM1701> \012- For characters with 28 or more Assassin levels, the honed weapon delivers mortal strikes, inflicting added damage and potentially killing the target instantly. Targets immune to critical hits now suffer full base damage if they fail their fortitude save. Targets not immune to critical hits suffer the full base damage if they make their save, and are instantly killed if they fail.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Legendary DC Increase<CUSTOM1701> \012- As described above, Honed Weapon DC increases for legendary Assassins:\012<CUSTOM1709>Assassin Level (including LLs)\057DC bonus\012------\01250 +7\01249 +6\01248 +6\01247 +6\01246 +5\01245 +5\01244 +5\01243 +4\01242 +4\01241 +4\01240 +3\01239 +3\01238 +3\01237 +2\01236 +2\01235 +2\01234 +1\01233 +1\01232 +1\01231 +0\01230 +0<CUSTOM1701>\012\012|;

A divine damage shield is also added to the effect at level 21, inflicting damage equal to the character's CHA bonus + 1d6 on anyone swinging at the character in melee combat. The base damage also increases by 50% at character level 41, to (3\0572xCHA bonus) + 1d6. It also provides 1% immunity to divine damage per point of charisma modifier, regardless of caster level. Characters with control class Paladin or Blackguard gain Shield AC equal to their Charisma modifier \057 2, if they do not receive Wisdom AC from any other source and do not belong to a quasiclass.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Great Smiting<CUSTOM1701> \012- Legendary Paladins, Blackguards, and Champions of Torm receive +1 Strength for each Great Smiting feat they possess upon taking level 41.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Divine Inspiration<CUSTOM1701> \012- Clerics Paladins and Blackguards with at least 36 base Charisma can find the Divine Inspiration ability which allows them to use Turn Undead as a Bard Song substitute.\012|;

In addition, if the turner has at least 3 levels in Paladin or Blackguard, 2 less than their number of Paladin and Blackguard levels are added to the character's turner level. Further, if the character has Smite Good or Smite Evil uses remaining and the Planar Turning feat, a Smite use will be expended and the 2-level penalty for Paladin or Blackguard will not be applied. Legendary levels count as turner levels, if the control class is Cleric, Paladin or Blackguard. Turner level is further increased by certain cleric domains.\012- Sun Domain adds +1 per 2 legendary levels for turning undead.\012- Plant Domain adds +1 per 4 legendary levels for turning vermin.\012- An elemental Domain (Fire, Water, Air or Earth) adds +1 per 4 legendary levels for turning elementals, if the Cleric has the Planar Turning feat.\012- An alignment Domain (Good or Evil) adds +1 per legendary level for turning outsiders, if the Cleric has the Planar Turning feat.\012- A turner may turn a total TR value of monsters equal to (turner level + Charisma modifier) * 3.\012- A turner's destruction DC is equal to 10 + (Turner levels \057 4) + (Cha modifier) + (2 within Medium radius or 1 within Huge radius).\012- When rolling to turn, a turner's Turn Power (TP) is equal to their turner level.\012- For all valid targets except constructs, if the turner's TP + d8 is greater than or equal to the target's Turn Resistance, the target will be turned. In addition, if the TP roll exceeds the target's TR by 10 or more, the target must make a Will save against the destruction DC or be destroyed.\012|;

If successful, the construct will take 1d3 points of damage per point of TP. In addition, if the turner has the Planar Turning feat, the construct must make a Will save against the turner's destruction DC or be destroyed.\012- Targets that are turned but not destroyed will be immobilized and unable to act. If they are damaged, they receive up to one Will save every round (against the turner's destruction DC) to free themselves. Optionally, the targets can be feared rather than immobilized, by using the <CUSTOM1708>!opt turnimmob<CUSTOM1701> SIMtools command.\012- Characters with the Planar Turning feat may now buy the Sun, Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Destruction, Good, Evil, and Plant domains as feats in legendary levels. These will not add domain spells, but do increase the breadth of turning ability.\012- Only characters with Blackguard levels can turn creatures of good alignment.\012|;

You may use it once every 6 minutes. This recharge time between uses is decreased by 20 seconds for every Great Smite feat the character has, and by 40 seconds more if they have the Extra Smiting feat. A Character with all 10 Great Smite feats and the Extra Smiting feat is able to use Greater Smite once every 2 minutes. Resting also recharges the ability. The character must recharge the ability after dying.\012- Greater smite can be targeted a short distance away. At the targeted area, you 'attack' every enemy in a large radius by rolling (Attack Bonus + Charisma Ability Modifier + 1d20) vs AC. Temporary AB buffs like spells and bard song are NOT included. If you hit, you deal (Number of Greater Smiting Feats +1) x (Total smiter levels) damage.

/Categories/[_]/EntryList/[_]/Text = qq|<CUSTOM1717>(continued from previous)<CUSTOM1701>\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Spells<CUSTOM1701> \012- DC: Characters with 15 levels of palemaster get a +1 bonus to necromancy and illusion DCs. This bonus increases by another +1 at 30 levels of palemaster, and again at level 45, for a total maximum of +3 to DC. Legendary levels count as palemaster levels for the purpose of gaining these dc increases, if the character's control class is palemaster.\012- CL: Palemasters calculate caster levels differently than they used to. They add a BASE caster level to their PM caster level for that spell school. The BASE caster level is their highest character level of wizard, sorceror, or bard, regardless of whether that class could cast the spell normally. The PM caster level is their PM level multiplied by either 1\0573 (for non-necromancy or illusion spells) or 7\0576 (for necromancy and illusion spells). THIS DOES NOT CHANGE SPELL PROGRESSIONS, ONLY THE CASTERLEVEL CALCULATION. Sorceror and PM levels still dont stack for the purposes of acquiring spells, for instance.\012\012Example: An 8 Bard \057 22 PM casts a necromancy spell. His BASE caster level is 8, and his PM caster level is 7\0576 * 22, or 25. His total caster level is 33 (8 BASE + 25 PM). If he was casting a non-necromantic, non-illusory spell, the BASE would still be 8, but the PM caster level would be 1\0573*22, or 7, for a total caster level of 8 BASE + 7 PM = 15. The game engine always rounds down, so the 'bonus' PM caster levels are acquired every 6 levels of PM. Likewise, for non-necromantic, non-illusory spells, caster levels are acquired every three levels. \012\012So, what do these caster levels affect? They ALWAYS affect spell penetration, and USUALLY effect duration, damage, and other effects. The only reason they wouldn't effect these other variables is that some spells have their effects capped at a lower level. Horrid Wilting, for instances, maxes out at 30 caster levels with respect to damage. Vampiric Touch, on the other hand, does not. \012\012- Palemasters do not gain their caster level benefit for the Ethereal Visage spell.\012- At level 20, Palemasters get a boosted Death Armor, doing up to 45 +1d6 dmg at maximum caster level (does 1\057caster level + 1d6), and lasting ten times as long.\012- Bestow Curse and Power Word Kill are now treated as necromancy spell, for the purposes of calculating caster level and effects for palemasters.\012|;

Wizard Pale Masters must have the identical spells memorized to use Lichsong (Sorcerer Pale Masters use only spell slots).\012- The Summon Creature IX ability casts Curse Song at the caster's Pale Master level, including legendary levels. Summon Creature VIII subtracts 5 levels from this;  VII 10 levels, and so on down to Summon Creature II at 35 levels below the caster's Pale Master level.\012- See the Bard journal entries for details on Curse Song.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Lifeblight<CUSTOM1701> \012- If a character gains 30 levels of Palemaster, not counting legendary levels, and conpletes the lich transformation, he gains this nefarious power. It is the equivalent of casting a vampiric touch on every enemy in the area of effect, and scales with legendary levels, as a necromantic spell, meaning that a 10 wizard 50 palemaster casts it at 68th level.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Bone Skin<CUSTOM1701> \012- Pale Masters receive +2 base AC at level 1. For every 4 levels thereafter, they receive 2 more AC, as normal. If, however, they have at least 25 base Strength or Dexterity, AC above the base +2 is halved to 1 point of AC per 4 levels.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Deathless Master Touch<CUSTOM1701> \012- At Pale Master 11, the DC on the Touch becomes 15 + (Pale Master level including LL - 10), reaching 55 at Pale Master 50.\012- At Pale Master 30 (not including LL), the Touch can be used an unlimited number of times per day.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Deathless Mastery<CUSTOM1701> \012- Instead of recieving full critical hit immunity at level 10, Pale Masters gain sneak attack immunity. At Pale Master 11 they gain 10% critical immunity which converts criticals into non-criticals 10% of the time. For each Pale Master level above 11 this increases another 10%, becoming full critical hit immunity at Pale Master 20.\012|;

Experienced dwarven defenders have little use for the Defensive Stance they rely on so heavily during their early training, since their own defense has become second nature to them. Instead, many opt to enter into the Defensive Weave, in which they whirl rapidly from stance to stance at alarming speed, forming a moving barrier of shield and armor. Any foe attempting to strike them in melee combat will take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 3 points per 2 dwarven defender levels. Each use of the Weave uses up one Stance use;  it may only be used if there are Stance uses remaining. The Weave lasts for 2 rounds per level of dwarven defender. Legendary levels count as dwarven defender levels for the purposes of damage and duration of the weave, making it cap at 75 + 1d6 damage and 100 rounds duration at dwarven defender level 50.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Dwarven Waraxe Shield AC<CUSTOM1701> \012- Dwarven Defenders receive one point of bonus Shield AC on any dwarven waraxe they equip for every point of Constitution Modifier they have, up to a maximum of +12 AC at 34 Constitution (including up to +12 Constitution from items).\012- This benefit is not received if the Dwarven Defender has more than one level of Ranger.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Natural AC Bonus<CUSTOM1701> \012- On achieving legendary levels, a character with dwarven defender as their control class gains a natural AC bonus of +1 per STR bonus, to a maximum of +20.

They still get all the other advantages of the class. Non-half-dragons have the opportunity to pick what color of dragon disciple they wish to be. They may only make this selection when they have between one and three levels of dragon disciple. They must find a secret location to select their path. Once chosen, they are unable to change their path. If no path is selected when they gain their fourth level of dragon disciple, they will be Red dragon disciples.\012\012Prismatic Half-Dragons are the exception to this rule.

In order to do this, however, they must take the Epic Toughness feats, a token of the investment they make in developing the hidden powers of their physique. To gain the full benefits of their DD levels, they must take the following feats by the following levels (or later, gaining the abilities for that level retroactively):\012level 20 - Epic Toughness 5\012level 25 - Epic Toughness 7\012level 30 - Epic Toughness 10\012\012- Dragon Disciples using the open Half-Dragon subraces (Half-Dragon - Black, Blue, Green, Red, or White) have lesser requirements than others, due to their dragon heritage. As a result, all Epic Toughness feat requirements are lessened by one for characters using the Half-Dragon subraces.\012- Dragon Disciples gain the following bonuses at the following Disciple levels, which include legendary levels if the character's control class is Dragon Disciple. The only change in the first 10 levels of standard gains is that DDs do not get +4 strength at level 10:\012<CUSTOM1709>2 : +2 Strength\0124 : +2 Strength\0127 : +2 Constitution\0129 : +2 Intelligence\01210: +2 Charisma, Dragon Breath improvement\01215: +2 Strength\012(Epic Toughness 5 requirement)\01220: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, Dragon Characteristics improvements\012(Epic Toughness 7 requirement)\01225: +2 Strength\012(Epic Toughness 10 requirement)\01230: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, Wing Buffet, Dragonfear Aura, and Draconic Size improvements\01235: +2 Strength\01240: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence\01245: +2 Strength\01250: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma<CUSTOM1701>\012\012- These bonuses are gained automatically on levelup - the character will be asked to relog until they take effect.

Once they find it, they will have to return every 5 levels to gain the next bonus.\012- The character need not take 30 levels of DD before legendary levels in order to keep advancing as a DD.

The most notable differences between hardcore mode and normal play is that WHEN YOUR CHARACTER RESPAWNS, THEY ARE DELETED.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Character Creation<CUSTOM1701> \012- You can make a hardcore ("HC") character either by making a character with -HC- in the name, or by using the PC Scrye conversation while you have zero experience points. If you use the scrye, the -HC- tag will be added at the beginning of your name. You can place the tag anywhere in the name if you do so during creation instead of using the scrye convo. If you use the scrye option, any items on the character will be deleted, as will any items and gold stored in the bank personal vault under their name. You will receive 1000 gp with which to equip yourself.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Character Deletion<CUSTOM1701> \012- When your HC character dies, if they are not resurrected in time, instead of respawning like a nomal character, they are deleted, and you will never be able to play them again. They are gone permanently, and no one, including dms, can bring them back.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Item Restrictions<CUSTOM1701> \012- HC characters face a number of restrictions with regard to items. They can only acquire items from looting enemies or from stores. The market chests are off limits to them, as are the transfer vaults in the bank. Items picked up by non-HC characters become unusable for HC characters. They are also unable to use second chance packs from the Item Shop.\012- HC characters are unable to use an item that at any time was held by a character more than 6 levels higher than them. If they acquire such an item, it will be destroyed. They can use the <CUSTOM1709>!itemlevel<CUSTOM1701> SIMTools command to tell the minimum level a hardcore character must be to use a given item.\012- Items place into personal vaults by hardcore characters are automatically tagged with a minimum hardcore level equal to the character's current level, even if the item previously had a lower minimum.\012|;

Nor are they able to receive buffs from non-HC characters, or be resurrected by them.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Death Restrictions<CUSTOM1701> \012- HC characters are unable to speak while dead. You will not be able to shout for help, or even make conversation with those nearby.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Subrace Restrictions<CUSTOM1701> \012- HC characters may only use subraces acquired when playing a HC character. HC subraces ARE available for use during non-HC play.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Hardcore Listing<CUSTOM1701> \012- The added challenge is the main reward to HC play. However, there's also the bragging rights. HC character records can be listed using the SIMTools command !list hardcore, which displays the top 50 characters by experience. It also shows whether the character is still alive, and how many times that character has logged out dead. Death logouts, since they cannot be distinguished from crashes, will not disqualify a character from hardcore status, but they are listed, so that any abnormally large numbers can speak for themselves.\012- Your hardcore statistics are updated in the listing only when you save with your saving pen. When you respawn, a global server message will go out announcing the sad event if you have acquired 10,000 experience points or more.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Special Protections<CUSTOM1701> \012- Because of their special status, HC characters are immediately resurrected without a respawn timer if they are killed by another player. They cannot pickpocket or be pickpocketed by non-HC players. They are also immune to the death caused by the breaking of the immortal crown.\012|;

The only difference between Hardcore and Softcore mode is that, instead of being deleted when they respawn, a softcore character is simply stripped of their status and has the -HC- removed from their name.\012- Softcore players are listed on a different list than hardcore players (<CUSTOM1708>!list softcore<CUSTOM1701>). When they respawn they are listed as 'Respawned' instead of 'Deceased', and their experience total in the listing is no longer increased when they gain experience. They are for all intents and purposes a normal, non-hardcore character from that point on.\012- All players that put -HC- in their names on creation are by default Hardcore, not Softcore. You can opt to become Softcore only by using the conversation option in the PC Scrye. If you are not already hardcore, you can only become softcore before you gain any experience, but if you are hardcore already to can opt to switch to softcore at any time without penalty.\012|;

/Categories/[_]/EntryList/[_]/Text = qq|Legendary and Paragon Levels are a mechanism by which your character continues to increase in power after level 40. They are NOT normal levels, and they only affect some of your character's attributes. The ONLY effects that they have are listed below. They do NOT help to qualify for abilities requiring a certain number of levels in a class UNLESS the description of the requirement specifically says that legendary and\057or paragon levels count towards meeting that requirement.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Skills<CUSTOM1701> \012- Characters gain their normal allotment of skill points for every legendary level, including racial and intelligence bonuses. They spend them in the usual manner, with class skills costing one point and cross-class skills costing 2 points. Points may be saved from level to level, if desired. Points saved from pre-legendary levels may also be used to buy skills during legendary leveling.\012- Characters gain 3 skill points for every paragon level. They spend them in the same manner as legendary levels, with one exception: characters cannot increase base ranks of a skill beyond 63. They can still buy points in a skill they have 63 ranks in, but those points will only count towards offsetting skill penalties - they will NOT be added to the base skill amount.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Feats<CUSTOM1701> \012- Characters continue to gain a general feat every three levels, beginning at level 42, 3 levels after the last received at level 39.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Feats<CUSTOM1701> \012- Characters gain ability points at an accelerated rate during legendary levels, receiving an additional ability point every 2 levels, beginning at level 42.\012- Characters gain a total in two points in each ability over the course of paragon levels. These points are spread out over the 20 paragon levels, and the order in which they are received is determined randomly at character creation.\012|;

This is implemented by granting characters 20 additional BAB at level 40, and then placing a -20 AB penalty on them. The penalty will decrease as you gain legendary and paragon levels. Depending on your character's control class, you will gain AB in one of three progressions:\012\012Tier 1:<CUSTOM1708> Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Blackguard, Champion of Torm, Dwarven Defender, Weapon Master<CUSTOM1701> AB increases at level 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, and 60, for a total of +15 BAB at level 60. \012\012Tier 2:<CUSTOM1708> Bard, Cleric, Druid, Rogue, Assassin, Red Dragon Disciple, Shadowdancer, Shifter<CUSTOM1701> AB increases at level 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, and 60, for a total of +12 BAB at level 60. \012\012Tier 3:<CUSTOM1708> All other classes<CUSTOM1701> AB increases at level 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, and 60, for a total of +9 BAB at level 60. \012\012-Characters receive +1 BAB every 4 paragon levels regardless of their control class, for a total maximum bonus of +5 BAB. This, like the legendary bonus, manifests as a reduction in the attack penalty, stacking with the legendary bonus.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Saving Throws<CUSTOM1701> \012- Character saving throws increase during legendary and paragon levels, but at a slower pace than before. A character gains +1 to all saving throws every 4 levels, beginning at level 44.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Hit Points<CUSTOM1701> \012- Characters automatically gain the maximum hitpoints for their class, including a bonus for the toughness feat and any constitution bonuses, during legendary and paragon levels.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Spells<CUSTOM1701> \012- Casterlevel: Legendary levels count as casterlevels, increasing the power of spells. Paragon levels do not count as casterlevels except in damage calculations for epic and paragon spells.\012- Spell Penetration: Legendary levels count as levels for the purpose of calculating spell penetration to overcome monster spell resistance. Paragon levels do not provide any bonus to spell penetration.\012|;

Legendary and paragon levels are NOT considered to be standard levels in a standard class. You cannot, for instance, use them to fulfill level requirements for feats, spells, abilities, and so on - those must all be met by level 40, unless the requirement in question specificaly states that legendary and\057or paragon levels count toward qualification. Legendary and paragon levels are, however, influenced by the character's 'Control Class'. It is the Control Class, for example, that determines how many hit points and skill points the character receives for Legendary Levels, the availability of feats and skills, and whether legendary levels count towards casterlevel of a given spell. The control class does not have as much weight in paragon levels, but it does still affect some things, such as hit points gained and feat\057skill availability.\012\012<CUSTOM1709>A character's control class is the class in which the character has the most levels. If two classes tie for having the most, the class the character took first will be the control class.<CUSTOM1701>\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Feat and Skill Availability<CUSTOM1701> \012- The Legendary Level system uses standard NWN rules to determine the availability of skills and feats, by treating the character as if they were taking a level in that character's Control Class.\012- Some changes have been made to available feats and skills on a class by class basis. The entries describing those classes list those changes.\012|;

/Categories/[_]/EntryList/[_]/Text = qq|This document provides an overview of the subrace system on Higher Ground.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Choosing a subrace<CUSTOM1701> \012- Subraces are chosen during character creation. After choosing a race, you have the option to select a subrace. This is your only chance to get it right. If you make a mistake, you will need to delete the character at the Rowan Guardian and try again.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>What do I put in the subrace field?<CUSTOM1701> \012- Enter the name of the subrace you want, as listed in the Subrace Details documents. This name is case-sensitive. Do NOT enter the quotation marks, only the name.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>What happens then?<CUSTOM1701> \012- You finish character creation. On entry to the Docks, you will be asked to relog, so that changes can be made to your character sheet. Do so, and on relogging, the changes will have been made.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Help! My subrace isn't working!<CUSTOM1701> \012- Check to make sure that you have the required race and tags for that subrace, that you entered the name correctly, and didn't put quotes around it.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>I did all that stuff and it still doesn't work! Is this just some cheesy attempt to draw players?<CUSTOM1701> \012- Yes. Err, no, I mean. SUBRACES WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR CHARACTER NAME HAS CERTAIN SYMBOLS IN IT, including the '!', '~', or '\057' characters.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>How come my Kobold can't use a two-handed sword?<CUSTOM1701> \012- SUBRACES THAT ALTER YOUR APPEARANCE MAY ALSO ALTER YOUR CHARACTER'S SIZE AND THE EQUIPMENT THEY ARE ABLE TO USE. These changes take effect once you log out and relog;  they are unavoidable. This does not apply to subraces that only add wings or a tail. Kobolds, for instance, are small creatures, and won't be able to use the same sizes of equipment that a human would, even though human is the race they are based off of. If a subrace is known to reduce a character's size, it is listed in the subrace characteristics. Please tell the dms if you discover that another subrace has changed your character's size. The list of size-reducing subraces currently includes Goblins, Kobolds, and Pixies. The list of size-increasing subraces currently includes Drider, Half-Ogre, Maelephant, Minotaur, Nobarian, Stinger, Treant, Troll, Wemic, Half-Cloud Giant and Half-Cyclops.\012|;

What gives?<CUSTOM1701> \012- Most subraces that change appearance will not show most equipment the character uses, typically revealing only weapon and shield. This does not apply to subraces that only add wings or a tail, or to dynamic appearance subraces.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>What does 'increased base movement rate' mean?<CUSTOM1701> \012- A few subraces, like Pixies, are faster than others. Rather than having a percentile speed boost which would not stack with effects like haste, they get their base movement rate altered. Here is a chart of the various speeds used by subraces:\012Slow Speed: walk 1.25m\057s, run 2.5 m\057s (Half-Ogre, Treant)\012PC Speed (standard): walk 2m\057s, run 4m\057s\012Fast Speed: walk 2.25m\057s, run 4.5m\057s (Averial, Badlander Halfling, Lycan, Stinger, Tallfellow Halfling, Thri-Kreen, Anarch, Wemic)\012Very Fast Speed: walk 2.75m\057s, run 5.5m\057s (Pixie, Shard)\012\012\012<CUSTOM1711>What's so secret about these secret subraces?<CUSTOM1701> \012- SECRET SUBRACES require a marker placed on the players account during gameplay. These markers go by playername (your GameSpy login), so you should keep that in mind if you use multiple playername accounts. Think of them as rewards for dedicated play, or as a rationing system for races that are less commonly found adventuring. You can see which secret subraces you can use with the <CUSTOM1708>!list subraces<CUSTOM1701> command.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>Are legendary levels counted when calculating subrace spell resistances?<CUSTOM1701> \012- Yes. A level 60 drow will have a 65 spell resistance, for example.\012\012<CUSTOM1711>What does the sign mean when it says that my dwarf can speak dwarven?<CUSTOM1701> \012- Most races and many subraces are able to speak in languages other than common. You can type <CUSTOM1708>!list languages<CUSTOM1701> to see what languages your character knows, and to get instructions on using those languages. Some classes also get class languages like thieves' cant. See the Class board for information on class languages.\012|;

Many have more than one FC, in which case neither counts when assessing experience penalties. In addition, some subraces have bonus classes (BC), which grant an experience bonus when the character has levels in them. 10% bonus is the standard BC bonus, and if a class grants more it than that it will indicate the total bonus. Some subraces disregard their highest class, like humans, and some, like Undying, never suffer experience penalties from multiclassing. Still others have different FCs for each gender.\012- Some subraces do not require any race. Some of these list Base Race as one of their FCs. This means that it uses the character's base race's FC for one of its FCs.\012- If no FC is listed, the subrace will have the same FCs as the character's base race.\012|;

In this mode, the Lifethreader will damage all nearby enemies and heal all nearby allies each round. Each round, a cleric spell memorized by the Lifethreader will be drained to fuel Lifethreading power.

It increases to 1.5 at level 38, to 2 at level 45, to 2.5 at level 53, and to 3 at level 60.\012- Allies affected by Lifethreading will be healed for the base amount times the multiplier. In addition, the healing multiplier increases by0.5 if the Lifethreader has at least 25 levels of Cleric, and by another 0.5 if the Lifethreader has 30 levels of Cleric. The heal effect also has a 5% chance to provide a Lesser Restoration for each level of the spell burned above 5 (max 20% for a level 9 spell). \012- Enemies affected by Lifethreading will be damaged by the base amount times the multiplier, with a fortitude save for half against a DC equal to ((Lifethreader level \057 2) + Wisdom modifier). In addition, the damage multiplier increases by 0.5 if the Lifethreader has at least 16 levels of Weaponmaster, and by another 0.5 if the Lifethreader has 20 levels of Weaponmaster. Further, their SR will be lowered by 1 point per 20 points of Heal skill possessed by the Lifethreader.\012- By default, the damage done is slashing damage, but at 14 levels of Weaponmaster, magical damage becomes available.

Bluff is used via the Taunt skill radial icon.\012- The defender must make an opposed Concentration check;  if it fails, its AB is lowered by the amount it failed the check by (to a maximum of -6) for 5 rounds.\012- The <CUSTOM1708>!opt tauntbluff<CUSTOM1701> command toggles between Taunt and Bluff. The two cannot stack on the same target. As with Taunt, Bluffing is a free action.\012\012<CUSTOM1710>Craft Armor<CUSTOM1701> \012- Now grants +1 AC per 40 points.\012\012<CUSTOM1710>Craft Weapon<CUSTOM1701> \012- Now grants +1 AB per 40 points when wielding a weapon.\012\012<CUSTOM1710>Listen<CUSTOM1701> \012- Increases your chances of hitting concealed enemies. Up to a skill of 60, the enemy concealment drops to (Concealment ** (1 + (Listen skill \057 60))). With a skill above 60, the enemy concealment drops to (Concealment ** (1.5 + (Listen skill \057 120))).\012- A Listen skill of 60 is equivalent to having the Blind-Fight feat in reducing enemy concealment, and skill and feat do not stack. '**' is the exponentiation operator.\012- If the above sounds too complex, remember that effective enemy conceal will be shown in-game.\012- Being deafened halves your effective listen skill - after all other calculations\012\012<CUSTOM1710>Lore<CUSTOM1701> \012- Can be used to increase the damage of elemental damage spells. The minimum Lore to receive a bonus is 21, and the bonuses increase through Lore 120, which grants 100% of the possible bonus in the area.\012\012<CUSTOM1710>Parry<CUSTOM1701> \012- Reduces damage taken from critical hits. The total damage taken is reduced by 1% per 2 points of Parry skill above 20, to a maximum of 50% with a skill of 120.\012- A skill of 100 or higher grants immunity to Assassin Mortal Strike.\012\012<CUSTOM1710>Pick Pocket<CUSTOM1701> \012- Pick Pocket DC is now increased by the target's Spot skill.\012\012<CUSTOM1710>Spot<CUSTOM1701> \012- Spot skill now increases the DC of pick pocket attempts against you, by 1 point per point of Spot skill.\012|;
